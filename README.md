# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page solution

This is my solution to the [Ping coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ping-single-column-coming-soon-page-5cadd051fec04111f7b848da). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic & Non-semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS (form validation)
- Mobile-first workflow
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of flex, grid, positioning w/ z-index, sizing w/ media queries, and JS form validation (how to work with ids and functions to authenticate information and/or create new divs inside of divs).

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more. -->

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on form validation using JavaScript, in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow, reference error solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70401866/how-to-fix-referenceerror-validateemail-is-not-defined) - This helped me figure out that I miss-labeled a function.
- [MDN, HTML form tag attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-novalidate) - This article helped me override HTML5 form validation, so that I could practice my JS skills. I'd recommend MDN to every web dev, new and old.
